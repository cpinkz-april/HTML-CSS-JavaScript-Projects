<h2>About Bill Gates</h2>
<p>William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American businessman and philanthropist. 
A pioneer of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, he co-founded the software company Microsoft in 1975 with his childhood friend Paul Allen. 
Following the company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO), Gates became a billionaire in 1987—then the youngest ever, at age 31. 
Forbes magazine ranked him as the world's wealthiest person for 18 out of 24 years between 1995 and 2017, including 13 years consecutively from 1995 to 2007. 
He became the first centibillionaire in 1999, when his net worth briefly surpassed $100 billion. According to Forbes, as of May 2025, 
his net worth stood at US$115.1 billion, making him the thirteenth-richest individual in the world.</p>
